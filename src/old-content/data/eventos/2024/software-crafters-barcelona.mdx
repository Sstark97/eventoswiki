## About the event / A place to share knowledge

Software Crafters Barcelona is a two-day event starting with the Friday Open Space and continuing a Saturday of exciting conferences, which aim to attract and connect software development professionals who feel passionate about their work and share the values and principles of the Crafters movement.

It aspires to be a meeting place that facilitates the magic of learning, teaching and collaboration, where participants create a gratifying and enriching experience.

It doesn't matter who you are, your knowledge level or your favorite programming language. We encourage you to participate if you:

- are passionate about software.
- want to be involved, or are already involved, in the Software Crafters movement.
- want to share your knowledge, experience, or skills.
- enjoy learning by helping others and believe that sharing is key to your own progress.

In addition to technical content, it will be fun. There will be beers, and we'll have stimulating conversations late into the night. Software Crafters Barcelona is an opportunity to meet new friends, face new challenges while learning and further improve your skills. Join us!

## DIVERSITY MATTERS / We welcome you

In the Software Crafters Barcelona movement brogrammers do not prevail, and year after year the organizational committee becomes more diverse.

We claim the Software Crafter movement as inclusive, because we know that diverse teams develop better software. That's why we want to make a clear invitation to collectives often underrepresented at tech events.

Women, migrants, racialized people, functional diversity folks, Lgb_circleTQIA+, etc: not only have we reserved tickets for you, but we also have a designated budget to facilitate your participation in the event. If you have any questions or suggestions, just drop us an email at [SoftwareCraftersBcn@gmail.com](mailto:SoftwareCraftersBcn@gmail.com) or DM us on Twitter [@bcnswcraft](https://x.com/bcnswcraft). We'll welcome you with open arms!

## CODE OF CONDUCT/ Don't be a jerk!

All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following [code of conduct](https://softwarecrafters.barcelona/coc.html). Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.
