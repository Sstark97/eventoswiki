## Details

In this session, you'll get a brief explanation about what are Web Components and why is a good idea to use them in large organizations such as BBVA. We'll talk about how was the scenario before Web Components, what do they solve and common problems you can experience using them in any framework.

We'll explain what is Lit, how it improves the development with Web Components and why we think Lit is a great library to implement Web Components and how it helps developers to keep close to the web standards.
